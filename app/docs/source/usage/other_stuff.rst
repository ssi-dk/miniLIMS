As mentioned, miniLIMS is designed to work for a specific group, but we're trying to keep the "miniLIMS" separated from the "miniLIMS for X". It's mostly separated but with some exceptions.

generic minilims stuff is inside the minilims folder and stuff specific to the local setup, such as workflows, steps, user roles... are in the instance folder.
